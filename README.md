Markov Chain Text Generator: Dad Joke Edition
=============================================

Prompt
------

We’d love to give you the opportunity to build a small full stack application.

  We’d like you to build a Markov chain automated text generator (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)). Our only restriction is that the data source for your application must use the icanhazdadjoke API (https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api), which has “internet's largest selection of dad jokes”. So think of your application as a new dad joke generator!  

You can use any tools you wish to create your application, including any libraries or languages you find useful, however we would like for you to manually implement the Markov generation logic in the language of your choosing. As you are building out your application consider interesting joke generation and application efficiency as your top priority!

As a stretch goal, we’d like for you to add caching to your application.

When you are ready to submit your test, send us either a .zip of your application in the link below or share a link to a repository. Keep in mind we will be cloning and spinning up your application locally to evaluate it.
